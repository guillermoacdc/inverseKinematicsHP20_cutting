# inverseKinematicsHP20_cutting
This repository has an automatic code generator for the Yaskawa HP20D-NX100 robot, implementing inverse geometric modeling to convert Cartesian to joint variables. Using a 2D optimal rectangular cut case, it aims to ease the work of students, educators, and researchers in experiments with the HP20D-NX100 robot and related equipment.
